    "Inorder to perform basket data analysis we need to know what are the items that were bought togther, since the data doesn't have a order id which can help us in understanding which items were bought together we use the survey_response_id and order_date to achieve the same. We concat survey_response_id and order_date and call it as transaction_id, later we group the purchases based on the transaction_id. Since for a given survey_response_id we are grouping the purchases based on the date purchased we can say that a specific customer purchased the items together."

    "**Challenge:** Out of 1.6M purchase records there are over 750K unique transaction ids and over 784K unique product names. All of this is actual purchase data collected from anonymous Amazon customers by Harvard for research purposes for the period late 2018 to early 2023. Amazon has millions of products, in order to perform basket analysis that yields decent metrics on millions of products we need 10s or 100s of millions of transactions. Since we don't have the right proportinate data i.e., the difference between the number of unique transaction ids and product names is significantly small and since we perform one-hot encoding on product names we would have over 784K columns and with such dimensionality it is nearly impossible to perform basket analysis with good support, lift and confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The solution to this is straightforward and simple, we just sample the data. We sample the data by taking the top 2000 most frequent transaction ids, sampling the data this way will allow us to capture more items that were bought togther and then the products that will be in cosideration would be only those that are part of these 2000 transaction ids. The proportion of number of unique transaction ids and product names is much better in this scenario, allowing us to perform basket analysis with way better support, lift and confidence."
